## Time Ontology in OWL

> **Abstract**
> > OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal properties of resources in the
> world or described in Web pages. The ontology provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological
> (ordering) relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations, and about temporal
> position including date-time information. Time positions and durations may be expressed using either the
> conventional (Gregorian) calendar and clock, or using another temporal reference system such as Unix-time, geologic time,
> or different calendars.
