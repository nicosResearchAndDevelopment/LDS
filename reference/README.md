## Time

### Time Ontology in OWL

> Abstract
> > OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal properties of resources in the
> > world or described in Web pages. The ontology provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological (
> > ordering)
> > relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations, and about temporal position
> > including
> > date-time information. Time positions and durations may be expressed using either the conventional (Gregorian)
> > calendar
> > and clock, or using another temporal reference system such as Unix-time, geologic time, or different calendars.
